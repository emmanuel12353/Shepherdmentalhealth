  <p class="lead">The Tony Elumelu Foundation is the leading philanthropy empowering a new generation of African 
  entrepreneurs, driving poverty eradication, catalysing job creation across all 54 African countries, and increasing 
  women economic empowerment. Since the launch of the TEF Entrepreneurship Programme in 2015, the Foundation has trained 
  over 1.5 million young Africans on its digital hub, TEFConnect, and disbursed over USD$100 million in direct funding to 
  20,000 young African women and men, who have collectively created over 400,000 direct and indirect jobs. The Foundation’s
   mission is rooted in Africapitalism, which positions the private sector,  and most 
  importantly entrepreneurs, as the catalyst for the social and economic development of the African continent. </p>
